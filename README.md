### hello!

The main repositories here are a Ruby profiler I wrote called [rbspy](https://github.com/rbspy/rbspy) and a [cookbook for learning pandas](https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook). There are also dozens of other tiny toy projects that I made for fun once and don't maintain at all.

Some other places you can find my work on the internet:
